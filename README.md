## Install

### Source

1. [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) 1.22.2
1. Clone this repo
1. Install the sunrise CLI

   ```shell
   make install
   ```

### Prebuilt binary

If you'd rather not install from source, you can download a prebuilt binary from the [releases](https://github.com/SunriseLayer/sunrise/releases) page.

1. Navigate to the latest release on <https://github.com/SunriseLayer/sunrise/releases>.
1. Download the binary for your platform (e.g. `sunrise_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz`) from the **Assets** section. Tip: if you're not sure what platform you're on, you can run `uname -a` and look for the operating system (e.g. `Linux`, `Darwin`) and architecture (e.g. `x86_64`, `arm64`).
1. Extract the archive

   ```shell
   tar -xvf sunrise_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
   ```

1. Verify the extracted binary works

   ```shell
   ./sunrised --help
   ```

1. [Optional] verify the prebuilt binary checksum. Download `checksums.txt` and then verify the checksum:

   ```shell
   sha256sum --ignore-missing --check checksums.txt
   ```

   You should see output like this:

   ```shell
   sunrise_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz: OK
   ```

See <https://docs.sunriselayer.io/run-a-gluon-node/nodes> for more information.

## Usage

```sh
# Print help
sunrised --help
```

# Start a single node devnet
./scripts/single-node.sh

# Publish blob data to the local devnet
sunrised tx blob pay-for-blob 0x00010203040506070809 0x48656c6c6f2c20576f726c6421 \
	--chain-id private \

## Contributing

This repo attempts to conform to [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) so PR titles should ideally start with `fix:`, `feat:`, `build:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, or `test:` because this helps with semantic versioning and changelog generation. It is especially important to include an `!` (e.g. `feat!:`) if the PR includes a breaking change.

<!-- This repo contains multiple go modules. When using it, rename `go.work.example` to `go.work` and run `go work sync`. -->
